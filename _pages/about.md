I am an associate professor at the [department of Economics](http://www.nek.uu.se), [Uppsala University](http://www.uu.se) and a research fellow at CESifo. I received my PhD from [CEMFI](http://www.cemfi.es), Madrid in 2015.

I am an applied economist, primarily working in political economy, labor economics, economic history, and behavioural economics. 

Here you can find my [publications](/research/) and a [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Luca_Repetto.pdf).


We are organizing a Workshop in Economic History in Uppsala, May 25 and 26 2023!  [Call for papers](/assets/Call_for_papers_WEH_upd.pdf)
