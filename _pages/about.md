I am an associate professor at the department of Economics, [Uppsala University](www.uu.se) and a research fellow at CESifo. I received my PhD from [CEMFI](www.cemfi.es), Madrid in 2015.
I am an applied economist, primarily working in political economy. I am also interested in labor economics and behavioural economics. 


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
