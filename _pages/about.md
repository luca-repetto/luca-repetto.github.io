I am an associate professor at the [department of Economics](http://www.nek.uu.se), [Uppsala University](http://www.uu.se) and a research fellow at CESifo. I received my PhD from [CEMFI](http://www.cemfi.es), Madrid in 2015.

I am an applied economist, primarily working in political economy and economic history. I have also done some research in behavioural and labour economics. 

Here you can find my [publications](/research/) and a [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Luca_Repetto.pdf).


 We are organizing a Workshop in Economic History in Uppsala, May 23 and 24 2024!  [Program](/assets/pdf/Call for papers 2024.pdf)
